# RichestRevealer Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), enhanced with integrations to a privacy-preserving Ethereum smart contract called **RichestRevealer**.

The frontend interacts with the smart contract to submit encrypted wealth values, compute the richest participant securely, and reveal results with privacy protections powered by the [Inco Lightning SDK](https://docs.inco.org/js-sdk).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.x
- npm or yarn or pnpm
- A wallet like MetaMask configured to your testnet (e.g., Goerli)
- Access to the deployed **RichestRevealer** contract address and ABI
- API keys or configuration for Inco Lightning SDK (testnet mode)

### Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd richestrevealer-frontend
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


### Key Files Explained

- **app/page.tsx**: The main UI entry point displaying participants, submission buttons, and results.
- **app/components/ContractInteraction.tsx**: Displays each participantâ€™s info with their submission and winner status and other components.
- **app/hooks/useRichestRevealer.ts**: Custom hook to interface with the RichestRevealer smart contract via `viem` and set toast fetch data and status.
- **utils/contract.js**: Contains the smart contract address and ABI for easy import.
